# SleepHart's Chat Command 
## Menu of outdated memes and obscure references (WIP)

Welcome! This is a list of all the chat sounds and overlay effects and what they do. A collection of cursed and ancient memes and random things I like/find funny.

Basically because I have - and am - implementing far too many of them - I thought it'd make life easier to list what they all are and what they do. Feel free to try these out to your heart's content - all of the ones listed here are intended for public use.

This is ridiculous and overkill but github is easiest way for me to list these, plus keep other stream stuff in one place.
